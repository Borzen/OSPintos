---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct file_descriptor
  {
    struct list_elem elem;      /* List element. */
    struct file *file;          /* File. */
    int handle;                 /* File handle. */
  };

A discriptor for a open file in the process. 

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File Descriptors are associated with open files by having a number assigned to them so you can find them.
File discriptors are unique within a system process as syscalls are only associated with a proccess. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

For a file read from the kernal it checks the handle to see if it is a file from the kernal.
Then it reads it in from a buffer for the size and then returns the size read in.
For a write we use put what we are writing into a buffer and then return the bytes writen.

In our implementation we would have to check for it at at least once. This is due to how we are copying in the data. However if the data went acrross two pages we would have to check it twice. When copying in 2 bytes of data the situation is the same as it depends on if it sperates into two pages. 

A way to improve this is to not check the addresses and let the system continue if there is an invalid address. This is a way to get 0 checks and would be way faster. On reads it would just keep on reading until it got to an invalid statement. However for system security we should not do this as this is unstable and might be dangorous on a large scale.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

it checks to see if the file is already in the virtual address. Then it is passed back by returning -1. 

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantanges to our implematation of file discriptors is that they are easy to lookup but yet complex enough to get the job done. 
A major disavantage is that they are linked to the process and not the filesystem as a whole.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
